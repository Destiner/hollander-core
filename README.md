# Hollander

![Heading](docs/hero.png)

## Introduction

The repository contains smart contract code for Hollander. Hollander is a contract that allows anyone to create ducth auctions for a pair of ERC20 contracts.

## Problem

It is frustrating to make large swap orders via DEXs. First, any large order creates significant price impact due to the lack of liquidity. Also, large orders are more vulnerable to sandwich attacks. Traders usually have to split the order into multiple small ones and set near 0 slippage tolerance (which increases the chances of tx being failed). Aggregators alleviate some of that, but they are inherently centralized and sometimes even pocket the positive slippage.

## Solution

Hollanders solves that via dutch auctions. Any trader can create an custom auction tailored to their needs. The auction will require a single transaction instead of creating multiple smaller trades. It will guarantee near market price execution and lowest price impact possible via economical incentives (no token incentives needed). The possibility of sandwich attacks is also eliminated.


## Use cases

For the hackathon, I choose to focus on whale token swaps. There are, however, other potential uses of the system.

First, it is possible to use Hollander for trustless . Currently, they are done either using predetermined price based on historical market rates (which is not efficient and open for price manipulation) or . Hollander can do treasure swaps both trustlessly and at market price.

Second, we can use Hollander for protocol liquiditations. By selling the underwater collater via dutch auction, we are guaranteed to receive the best price while reducing reliance on centralized oracles.

Finally, token buybacks (e.g. https://yearn.clinic) can also be conducted via Hollander, eliminating the dependency on oracles.

## Mechanism design

The auction swaps token `A` to token `B`. The auction starts at the given price. As the time goes, the price will decrease. The decrease is exponential â€” the price will halve in `X` amount of time, then halve again in `X` amount of time, and so forth. Eventually, the current spot price will reach the market price, which will create an arbitrage opportunity. Anyone can sell any amount of tokens (within limit) to this auction, but the price will increase based on the amount sold. Small amount of tokens will increase the price slightly, but the large amount of token increases the price significantly.

### Parameters

Each auction is initialized witha set of problems:

- `tokenBase`: token to be sold via auction by creator
- `tokenQuote`: token to be bought via auction
- `amountBase`: amount of token to be sold
- `initialPrice`: starting spot price
- `halvingPeriod`: amount of blocks for price to halve
- `swapPeriod`: target amount of blocks for auction to be held
